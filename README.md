# YouTube-Clone

*In this project, I created header and nav bar and used the display attribute in a flex way. For the main part, I achieved the responsive design I wanted by creating a nested layout with the grid system and determining the number of columns. I got the desired relationship by making the positions of the header and nav bars relative and making the position of some elements in bars absolute. By using the Google font in the body part, I reduced the code redundancy with the inherit feature.*
